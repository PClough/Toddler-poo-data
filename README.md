# Toddler-poo-data
2020 in poos (5 - 17 months old)

Throughout 2020 I recorded every poo that my toddler wonderfully produced for us. 
He started 2020 about 5 months old and finished about 17 months old. 
At 5 months old he was on breast milk only and transitioned to solids around 6 months. 

Raw data is uploaded as well as python codes for analysis and plotting. 


Impact function for poo data is equal to number of poos + absoloute value of (bristol stool scale score - 4)) * size of poo
